Fig1: Area that with decreasing NPP(for 2 species) trend during 1991-2018
Fig2: Trends of NPP for different periods
Fig3: Number of species that was significantly limited by environment---there is 7 species under investigation(so the maximum vlaue could be 7)
Fig4: Limitng environmental variables (lower panel for each species) and the limting intensity for most limiting factor(upper panel) for each species
